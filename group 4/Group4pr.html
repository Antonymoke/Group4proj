		<p>The effect of sunlight on the growth of a mesocosm</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="Purpose">
		<h2 id="Purpose" >  Purpose </h2>
		
		<p>The purpose of this experiment is to investigate and assess how sunlight impacts the biotic and components of an ecosystem (plants in particular) and their growth.  We will use mesocosms (miniature ecosystems in a controlled environment) and change the sunlight that the mesocosm receives and measure how that effects on the growth and behavior of plants within the system. By comparing mesocosms with different light treatments, we hope to gain insights into the ecological impacts of changes in solar radiation, which could have important implications for the management and conservation of natural ecosystems.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If the sunlight reaching the mesocosm increases, the growth of the plants will increase as well?</li>

		<div class="Procedure">
			<h2 id="Procedure" >  Procedure  </h2>
			<li>Prepare an empty jar and place small stones at the bottom.</li>
		<li>Pour soil in the jar until about 2/3 of the jar is full</li>
		<li>Place the seeds in, then add a little bit more soil just enough to cover the seeds</li>
		<li>Cover the mesocosm with a lid or plastic wrap to prevent evaporation and contamination</li>
		<li>Place the mesocosm in a closed room next to a window, in an area clearly allowing sunlight to reach it. </li>	
		<li>Record the plant growth with a measuring tape after 1 week</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 1-6 for another mesocosm, except now place the mesocosm in an area where sunlight canâ€™t possibly reach it. Make sure this mesocosm is in the same room as the other mesocosm to keep the temperature the same. </li>

		<li> <justify>Independant variable: The sunlight ( it is changed by placing a jar in the sun, and a jar in the shade) </justify> </li>
		<li>Dependant variable: The hight of the mesocosm(it is measured using a ruler and measuring tape) </li>
		<li>Controlled variable 1: The same temperature (keep both in the same temp)</li>
		<li>Controlled variable 2: The same seeds for both mesocosms(it can vary the results if different ones are used). </li>	
		<li>Controlled variable 3: The same  soil for both mesocosm( the nutrient content can drassticly vary, and change the outcome if not the same)</li>

		<section class="Results">
			<h2 id="Results" >  Results </h2>
		<p>Sunlight is a critical factor for photosynthetic organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria, which use the energy from the light to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and organic compounds. This leads to an increase in biomass and primary productivity, temperature increase, changes in metabolism, growth rates, and behavior, as well as changes in nutrient cycling and community structure.</p>

				<h2 id="Application">  Application </h2>
		<p>Mesocosms can be used to study the effects of climate change, water quality, conservation biology, and agriculture. They can be used to simulate the effects of climate change on ecosystems, monitor water quality, reduce pollution, and protect endangered species. They can also be used to study agricultural practices and soil health and biodiversity.</p>

		<section class="Conclusion">
			<h2 id="Conclusion" >  Conclusion  </h2>
		<p>Mesocosms are powerful tools that simulate complex ecosystems in a controlled environment. They provide insights into how environmental stressors affect ecosystems, and can teach us about the relationships between organisms and their environment. They also provide a cost-effective and practical alternative to studying ecosystems in the field, allowing for mitigation measures to be put in place before potential disasters occur. Mesocosms are essential tools in the study of ecology, conservation, and environmental science.</p>
